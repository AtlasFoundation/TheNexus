# TheNexus
The city that comes to you. An open source, hackable, community-driven and CC0 experiment in open metaverse.

## Installation Instructions
This project uses Git LFS to manage large files. Git on it's own isn't super great with some kinds of binary files.

First, you will need to install Git LFS
```sh
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

Now clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thenexuscity/thenexus && cd thenexus
```

You shouldn't need to do anything special after that.

If you don't feel comfortable using Git, you can check out this tutorial to get yourself up to speed:
