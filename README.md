# The Nexus
The city that comes to you. An open source, hackable, community-driven and CC0 city for the open metaverse.

We can build anything if we do it together.

## Setup Instructions
The project uses vanilla Blender 3.0 or above. For the best experience, use the latest version.
You don't need any special plugins or anything. If you've never used Blender, start here:

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thenexuscity/thenexus && cd thenexus
```

You shouldn't need to do anything special after that.

When you have made something cool, you can add it to your git and push it
```sh
git add <filename>.blend
git commit -m "Added <feature> to <filename>
git push
```

Contributors welcome. Creators appreciated. Guidelines incoming, but for now any contributions will be reviewed. Please post photos to make it easy, and try to remove any unused or unlinked assets to keep your files small.

Deleting orphan files and removing unused assets will keep out github from exploding. Here's a tutorial:
