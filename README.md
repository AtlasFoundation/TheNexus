# The Nexus
The city that comes to you. An open source, hackable, community-driven and CC0 city for the open metaverse.

We can build anything if we do it together.

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thenexuscity/thenexus && cd thenexus
```

You shouldn't need to do anything special after that.
